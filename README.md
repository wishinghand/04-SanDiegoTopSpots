# Day 4 of Origin Code Academy:

## Top Spots of San Diego

This project showed us how to use an AJAX call to grab JSON data from an external source. They were then displayed in a table that was built programmatically from however many results were retrieved.

The technologies used were:
- HTML
- CSS (with Purecss.io)
- Javascript (with Jquery for AJAX)
- Bower (to import Pure and Jquery)
- Node-static (to run it locally without CORS issues)
